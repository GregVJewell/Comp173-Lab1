How to compile this code!

Make sure to uncompress the folder that contains the following:
	1. Makefile
	2. simple-shell_skeleton.c
	3. loop.py
	
After this, you can compile the code by using the included Makefile by typing:

	unix >> make
		OR
	unix >> make clean all
	
After compilation, give the new file the exe attribute to become runnable:

	unix >> chmod +x simple_shell
	
After making the exe:

	unix >> ./simple_shell
	
Do as you will from here! :D
